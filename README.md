# C++ Regex Matcher

This is an educational library for matching regular expressions.
It runs extremely fast, a few orders of magnitude faster than built in C++11 libraries, and beats in performance almost any other wide known library.
However it is very minimalistic: Operates on ASCII symbols only, does not support multi-threading nor multi-core support.
The library was tested under iOS, Android, Windows and Linux.
